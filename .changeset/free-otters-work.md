"@radix-ui/react-icons": major
---

- Added new icons:
  - `Database`
  - `ExclamationCircled`
  - `ExclamationMark`
  - `Filter`
  - `Globe2`
  - `Minimize`
  - `PanelBottom`
  - `PanelBottomMinimized`
  - `PanelLeft`
  - `PanelLeftMinimized`
  - `PanelRight`
  - `PanelRightMinimized`
  - `People`
  - `Server`
- Build output is no longer bundled into a single entrypoint. Icons are still exported from a main entrypoint, but separate chunks are maintained for better tree-shaking.
- Updated SVGO to further reduces the size of the icons. The resulting SVGs no longer include `fill-rule="evenodd"` or `clip-rule="evenodd"` where they are not needed.
